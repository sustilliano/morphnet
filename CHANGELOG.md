### Technical Details

- **Language**: Rust 2021 edition
- **Minimum Rust Version**: 1.70.0
- **Dependencies**: Carefully curated set of stable crates
- **Platforms**: Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Architecture**: x86_64, ARM64

### Performance Metrics

- **Classification**: <50ms per 1024×1024 image on modern hardware
- **Template Extraction**: <15ms per classification
- **Patch Processing**: >1000 patches/second
- **Spatial Updates**: 10Hz real-time monitoring capability
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB baseline, scales linearly with data size

### API Stability

- **Public API**: Stable, following semantic versioning
- **Internal APIs**: May change between minor versions
- **File Formats**: MMX format is stable and backward compatible
- **Configuration**: Template and configuration formats are stable

## Security Considerations

### [0.1.0] Security Features

- **Memory Safety**: Rust’s ownership system prevents common vulnerabilities
- **Data Integrity**: SHA-256 checksums for all stored data
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all external inputs
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated security audits of dependencies
- **No Unsafe Code**: Pure safe Rust implementation

### Known Limitations

- **File System Access**: Requires read/write permissions for data storage
- **Network Access**: Currently no network functionality (future feature)
- **Privilege Requirements**: Runs with user-level permissions only
