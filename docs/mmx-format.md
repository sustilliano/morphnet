Absolutely! Here’s a detailed expansion for your mmx_format.md that covers the file layout, all key structures, atomicity, chunking, and streaming features, with technical rigor and commentary suitable for both developers and architects:

⸻

MMX Format Specification

The MMX (Multimedia Matrix) format powers atomic, multimodal, tensor-backed storage and streaming for the MorphNet framework.
It is engineered for fast I/O, live updates, journaling, and efficient recovery—optimized for computer vision, geometry, robotics, and AI.

File Layout

An MMX file is a binary container with the following high-level structure:

+-----------------+
|  Header (fixed) |
+-----------------+
|  Directory      |
+-----------------+
|  Chunk 1        |
+-----------------+
|  Chunk 2        |
+-----------------+
|  ...            |
+-----------------+
|  Directory Copy |
+-----------------+

Order and details:
	1.	Header (4096 bytes, fixed, aligned)
	•	Magic bytes (b"MMX\x00")
	•	Version (u32)
	•	JSON-serialized header metadata (see Header Fields)
	•	Padding to 4096 bytes for fast mmap/seek
	2.	Directory
	•	Serialized chunk directory describing each block in the file (names, offsets, types, checksums, etc.)
	•	Placed at both the start (optional) and always at the end of file for journaled atomicity and append.
	3.	Chunks
	•	Each data chunk is self-contained, typed, and can be compressed
	•	Chunks may represent tensors, images, video frames, meshes, text, embeddings, metadata, or user-defined modalities
	4.	End-of-File Directory Copy
	•	After all chunks, the current directory state is written again
	•	Enables safe recovery and file scanning—even after partial writes or crashes

⸻

Header Fields

The header encodes global information for the file and provides safe detection/validation.

Example (JSON-serialized in header region):

{
  "version": 1,
  "file_id": "baf0db68-7ae2-4fd7-8991-01cce14b9d7b",
  "created": "2025-06-05T12:34:56Z",
  "creator": "joseph@sustilliano.com",
  "model_uuid": "f8e8b0d1-8c4e-42bb-9a30-bafd0731b871",
  "modality_summary": {
    "Tensor": 11,
    "Mesh": 2,
    "Text": 3
  },
  "total_chunks": 16,
  "file_size": 24519784
}

	•	version: MMX format version
	•	file_id: Unique file identifier (UUID)
	•	created: ISO8601 timestamp
	•	creator: User or system who created the file
	•	model_uuid: (Optional) Model used to generate data
	•	modality_summary: Count of each chunk modality present
	•	total_chunks: Count of all chunks
	•	file_size: File size in bytes (set on close)

⸻

Chunking and Atomicity

Chunks are independently readable/writable blocks:
	•	Each chunk starts at a file offset and has its own metadata entry
	•	Chunks may be added, overwritten, or deleted without corrupting other data
	•	Supported chunk types (see src/mmx/mod.rs):
	•	Tensor, Sequence (video/timeseries), Text, Mesh, Embedding, Meta

Atomic Write/Update:
	•	On every file mutation, a new directory is written at the file end
	•	Old directories remain valid until overwrite is complete (journaled, crash-safe)
	•	No global file lock required for appends or reads (safe for concurrent access)

Compression & Integrity:
	•	Each chunk can be stored raw, LZ4, or zlib-compressed
	•	Each chunk can be checksummed (SHA-256)
	•	Chunk metadata includes offset, length, compression, dtype, shape, and logical grouping

⸻

Directory Structure
	•	The directory is a map of chunk names to metadata.
	•	Includes logical path, chunk type, file offset, size, compression type, shape, dtype, logical region, and checksum.

Example:

"chunks": {
  "frames/00001": {
    "name": "frames/00001",
    "chunk_type": "Tensor",
    "offset": 4096,
    "size": 921600,
    "compression": "Lz4",
    "shape": [480, 640, 3],
    "dtype": "float32",
    "logical_region": "video_segment_A",
    "checksum": "7c4a8d09ca3762af61e59520943dc26494f8941b"
  },
  ...
}

	•	Arbitrary logical namespaces and pathing, e.g., frames/, patches/, mesh/, etc.

⸻

Data Types

TensorData
	•	Arbitrary-dimensional arrays (float32, uint8, etc.)
	•	Used for images, videos, activations, weights

MeshData
	•	3D vertices, faces, normals, uvs, materials
	•	Can represent surface patches or full templates

SequenceData
	•	Ordered frame references, FPS, metadata
	•	Supports video, time-series, sensor streams

TextData
	•	Text content (UTF-8/other), tokens, language

EmbeddingData
	•	2D or ND array (samples x embedding_dim), method (PCA, UMAP, etc.)

MetaData
	•	Arbitrary JSON blobs, versioned, timestamped

⸻

Streaming and Live Write
	•	Chunked streaming: Write new frames/patches incrementally (append-only), directory keeps track of latest
	•	Partial reads: Only chunks of interest are mapped/decoded—ideal for low-latency use (e.g., e-ink, robotics, AR)
	•	Atomic caching: Local buffer is flushed only when chunk and directory write complete

⸻

API Guarantees
	•	All reads and writes are atomic at the chunk level
	•	File remains consistent even after abrupt shutdown (last valid directory is scanned on load)
	•	Parallel access supported (reads never block, writes only block append region)

⸻

Example API Calls

// Create new MMX file
let mut mmx = MMXFile::create("output.mmx", "sustilliano".to_string())?;

// Write a video frame tensor
mmx.write_tensor("frames/00001", tensor)?;

// Write a mesh
mmx.write_mesh("meshes/frame001", mesh)?;

// Read back a tensor
let tensor = mmx.read_tensor("frames/00001")?;


⸻

Planned Extensions
	•	Transactional Journaling: Multi-operation commits/rollback
	•	Fine-grained permissioning: Access control on logical regions
	•	Remote streaming: Incremental upload/download over network
	•	Versioned/branchable file trees: For collaborative spatial intelligence work

FAQ

Q: Why not HDF5, Parquet, NPZ, etc.?
A: MMX is atomic, append-friendly, cross-modal, and specifically tuned for high-throughput, journaling, and low-latency AI/robotics pipelines. It combines the best of scientific file formats and streaming logs.

Q: Can I use MMX for non-vision data?
A: Absolutely—any tensor, mesh, sequence, or document structure is supported.
