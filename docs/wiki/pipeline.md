# Data Pipeline

The MorphNet pipeline flows through several stages:

1. **Data Acquisition** – Raw sensor data is converted into tensors, meshes or other structures and written to an MMX file using the `MMXFile` API.
2. **Template Processing** – `TemplateFactory` constructs geometric templates which are stored alongside data chunks in the same MMX container.
3. **Network Execution** – A `MorphNet` instance consumes tensor data and templates to perform classification or other tasks. Results can be stored back into MMX chunks.
4. **Patch Refinement** – Intermediate mesh fragments are collected in `PatchQuilt` and may later be used to refine a full mesh representation.
5. **Spatial Monitoring** – Events and metrics are generated by `SpatialAwareness` utilities which track risk levels and prediction horizons.
6. **Analysis** – Embedding matrices or other outputs can be examined with `MorphNetAnalyzer` to compute statistics or visualize relationships.

Each stage can operate independently but together they form a complete workflow for ingesting data, learning templates, refining geometry and assessing spatial behavior.
